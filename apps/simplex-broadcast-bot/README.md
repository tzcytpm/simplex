# SimpleX broadcast bot

The bot allows anybody to connect to it and re-broadcasts all messages received from specified users configured via CLI options (publishers) to all users.

Welcome message and reply to the users who are not set as publishers can also be configured via CLI options.

It's a poor man's feed, until we have a better support for feeds in SimpleX Chat.

We use it to broadcast status notifications for SimpleX Chat servers when we do any maintenance or in case they become unavailable.
