# Include (Optional) Images in User Profiles

1. Add SQL migration for database in `src/Simplex/Chat/Migrations`
    - This will touch `contact_profiles` and `group_profiles`

2. Add field to `User` in `Types.hs` allowing for null entry using `Maybe`

3. Extend parsing in `Chat.hs` under `chatCommandP :: Parser ChatCommand`

4. Update `UpdateProfile` in `Chat.hs` to accept possible display picture and implement an `APIUpdateProfile` command which accepts a JSON string `/_profile{...}` which will add the image to a profile.

5. Connect up to Android and iOS apps (new PRs)

Profile images will be base 64 encoded images. We can use the `base64P` parser to process them and pass them as JSON.
