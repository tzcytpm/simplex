<p>Transitioning from a lifelong career dedicated to nonprofits,
including Board roles at organizations like the Wikimedia Foundation, Access Now and Tor,
my decision to join SimpleX Chat may come as a surprise to some.

that have guided me here, shedding light on what I think sets SimpleX Chat apart
and why this move feels like an essential learning opportunity.</p>
